title: Check status of Xen/XCP virtual machines

description: 
  The check matches the list of running virtual machines against the list of virtual machines on the host. 
  It will return "OK" if a VM is running, CRIT if a VM is in the states "c- crashed" or "s - shutdown" or UNKWOWN if the VM is not found in the xm list output. 
  The check supports only the old-style "xm" command set, support for "xl" as used in Xen4.2 and up will be added. Citrix XenServer will not be supported.


Explanation: 
  Since Xen VMs may be destroyed upon shutdown, it is not possible to safely determine if a VM is missing or shut down, unless you are using the "correct" settings (i.e. start the VM using xm new + xm start instead of xm create).
  Unfortunately xm start is broken on debian, whereas CentOS/RHEL are missing the important --state option to xm list. On SUSE and Oracle VM you should find a working xen-tools setup and can use xm new to create VMs.


parameters:
  as of now the check has no parameters. A parameter xenvm_allowed_states could be added. Let me know if you need it.

inventory:
  the check plugin generates one service per VM that is visible on the host at inventory time.

perfdata: 
 The check does not generate performance data. It is planned to display the CPU and RAM usage per domU, but this is not possible without support from xen-devel.
